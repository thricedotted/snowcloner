      <span slot="title">Where do the corpora come from?</span>

      <p>
        They are from <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora">Corpora</a>, a public domain repository of lists of words and other structured language data. It was created with the goals of rapid project prototyping and as a teaching tool, both of which inspired and, I hope, are furthered by Snowcloner. It's a wonderful resource created and maintained by volunteers; if there is data that you'd like to play with in Snowcloner that's not yet in the repository, consider contributing it to Corpora!

      <span slot="title">How was Snowcloner made?</span>

      <p>
        The two most important components of Snowcloner (after you, the author of the snowclone ðŸ˜Š) are <a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora">Corpora</a> and <a href="https://tracery.io/">Tracery</a>, which we rely on for the data and the text generation framework, respectively. Snowcloner exists because I wanted to bring these two powerful resources together in a novel and accessible way!
